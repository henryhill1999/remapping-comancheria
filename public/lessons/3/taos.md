## Comanche Trade

Despite ongoing warfare in other parts of the Spanish borderlands, many towns such as Taos nurtured valuable trading relationships with Comanches. Sometimes these relationships went deeper, establishing kinship ties and leading to the Comanche language being spoken in the town. Some Comanches likely settled in Taos over time, explaining the mixed heritage which produce modern performances of _Los Comanches_.

Taos markets were known to exchange a variety of goods from guns, tobacco, and hatchets to animal products like bison hides. However, two of the most profitable (for Comanches) and most frustrating (for Spanish authorities) commodities were captives and horses, often directly from other parts of New Mexico or Texas (Hämäläinen, 2008; 83-84).
