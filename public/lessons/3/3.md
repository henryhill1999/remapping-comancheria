## Identity Crises

In this section, we will set the stage for the Mexican-American war, telling the story of how Indigenous peoples, especially Comanches, precipitated one of the largest acquisitions of land in US history. Perhaps most obviously, this is a story of war and land - land which was once claimed by Mexico being incorporated into the United States. By the end, much of the Mexican North will nominally be the American Southwest. Meanwhile, much as in the Southeast, the majority of this land was nonetheless Indigenous, in law and in fact.

However, it is also a story about identity - how Americans became Mexicans, Mexicans became Americans, Texans were a confusing mess, and Indigenous peoples left an indelible mark on the region’s cultural heritage (Reséndez, 2004; 2).
