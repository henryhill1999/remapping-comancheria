## From New Spain to Mexico

In 1821, Mexico won independence from Spain, redefining the map of the Southwest. However, the new regime in Mexico City would face many of the same challenges in its northern provinces as the old one had decades previously. Now an independent nation, Mexico sought to establish a common national identity and consolidate its domain. However, for ambitious Mexican nationalists, pursuing the former would come at the expense of the latter, as increasing hostility to Comanche power would come to fray the profitable peace, which continued more or less for five decades (DeLay, 2008; 34-37).
