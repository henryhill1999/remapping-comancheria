## Enter, Stage Left

It was this world of sovereign Indigenous power and fraying relationships which saw the United States took its first steps into the Southwest. Just as Jackson began the forced migration of Southeastern peoples across the Mississippi, he was already looking westward toward Texas. Months into removal, Jackson was confronted by the reality that the land designated “Indian territory” was already inhabited. Newcomers were soon forced to compete with Osages, Pawnees, and Wichitas for resources (DeLay, 2008; 4). Placed amongst an unfamiliar landscape with few of the resources that had enabled many of these eastern peoples’ ways of life, conflict soon ensued (Saunt, 2020; 196-198).
