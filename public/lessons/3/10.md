## The Far North

The raids of the late 18th century would be only the beginning of Comanche influence in the region. Throughout the ensuing decades, the Spanish and Mexican states would have a strained relationship with the people on the ground, at times amounting to outright neglect (DeLay, 2008; 142-143).

Unable to obtain what they needed from the state, the people on the ground in places like _Taos_ were all too happy to trade with nomadic raiders, much to the chagrin of Spanish officials (Hämäläinen, 2008; 82-85).

Faced with poverty and famine, the supposed Spanish (and later, Mexican) identities of these people amounted to little when the state attempted to exercise its supposed power by prohibiting trade with Comanches.
