## The Frontier, continued

US interest in the northern Mexico was not new by 1846. As early as 1819, US negotiators had insisted on a long-standing claim to the territory. The basis? A French explorer, who had shipwrecked on the coast in 1685, “discovering” Texas for France. Having acquired France’s colonial possessions in the Louisiana Purchase, the United States insisted on the right to settle the land (DeLay, 2008; 2).

Known sometimes as the _Doctrine of Discovery_, this invocation of 17th century explorers once again reveals the process by which Indigenous land was consistently ignored and delegitimized by European-Americans. They were nonetheless powerless to enforce their claims against Indigenous sovereignty on the ground, as the treaties with they made with Indigenous peoples well recognize.

Consistently violating the _Doctrine of Discovery_’s convenient fiction, sovereign Kiowas, Apaches, and Comanches (among others) dictated the state of affairs in these lands, far more than any non-Indigenous people. Their societies would shape the coming war, both in its making and outcome, challenge the roots of Mexican national identity, and leave a mark on the land that persists to this day.
