## Identity Crises

When we speak about national identity, we often think in terms of black and white. A person might have been Mexican or American - maybe even both, or perhaps neither, if weâ€™re being creative. But rarely do we consider how these limits of these concepts place arbitrary boundaries on the ways we can think about the past.

How are we to approach people in a place like Texas, which would go from Spanish, to Mexican, to independent, to American in just a matter of decades? When we think of national identity this way, who are we leaving out?

As we will see, despite our black and white intuitions, the Southwest borderlands between the United States, Mexico, Texas, and Indigenous domains presented numerous shades of grey.
