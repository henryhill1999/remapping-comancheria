## Las Vegas, New Mexico

The US military occupation of New Mexico began in 1846. Facing little resistance, Colonel Stephen Kearny marched the Army of the West into Las Vegas, one of a handful of Mexican settlements.

> _“I have come amongst you by the orders of my government, to take possession of your country, and extend over it the laws of the United States. We consider it, and have done so for some time, a part of the territory of the United States, We come amongst you as friends, not as enemies - as protectors, not as conquerors. [...] I now tell you that those who remain peaceably at home, attending to their crops and their herds, shall be protected by me in their property, their persons, and their religion._"

Administering an oath of allegiance to the present New Mexican officials, Colonel Kearny addressed the crowd which had assembled: "I shake hands with you all, through your [mayor] and hail you as good citizens of the United States." (Reséndez, 2004; 237-238)
