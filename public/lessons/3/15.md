## Looking West

However, at the heart of Jackson’s ambitions to obtain Texas lay another matter of national identity. Following the Texas colonization law of 1825, Mexico had allowed migrants from the United States to settle in the province. Tempted by the offer of cheap land a new life under Mexican citizenship, the 1820s saw a “deluge” of these settlers enter Texas (DeLay, 2008; 4-5).

Jackson, determined to harness this settlement for the westward expansion of the United States, wrote vehemently of acquiring a more generous boundary line. In his view, these émigrés were Americans, representing the inevitable forces of manifest destiny, “thrown into the province of Texas” (DeLay, 2008; 4-5).
