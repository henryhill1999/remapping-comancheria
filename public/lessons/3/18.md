## Raiding Renewed

Galvanized by the loss of loved ones below the Rio Grande, every year, new Comanche raids would spring forth in the name of vengeance, each more vigorous than the last. Each successive blow from the Comanches would push deeper into the heart of Mexico, shattering the northern provinces’ faith in their government, plundering more of the country’s wealth, and producing more dead Comanches to be avenged in the next year (DeLay, 2008; 129).

By the time of US invasion in 1846, Comanche raids would "undermin[e] Mexican community at nearly every level" (DeLay, 2008; 198).
