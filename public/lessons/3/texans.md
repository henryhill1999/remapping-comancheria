## New Texans

In the 1820s, many Americans fled the US in favor of settlement in Mexico. While some were merely opportunistic and had no intention of integration, others shed their American identities eagerly to escape increasing taxes and debt - learning Spanish and adopting catholicism to do so. The Panic of 1819 had destroyed the finances of many Americans, so a new life in Mexico often meant avoiding debtor’s prison.

Debtors did not account for all of the new Mexicans though. Even the eventual “father of Texas,” _Stephen F. Austin_, a former US citizen, would initially embrace his new Mexican identity, however short lived. Reportedly, Austin vehemently opposed annexation by the United States, calling it “the greatest misfortune that could befall Texas at this moment” (DeLay, 2008; 4-5).
