## Texas and New Mexico

To answer this question, we must learn more about the people inhabiting the Southwest. What on the surface might appear to be a continuous domain of Spanish control in Texas and New Mexico by 1800 was really a sparse group of settlements and _pueblos_. Since its days as a Spanish colony in the 1770s, New Mexicans had lived something of a double life, trapped between the nominal power of the Spanish state and the geopolitical reality of Comanche domination.

In Texas, things weren’t much brighter for the supposed colonizers. Even by 1827, Southwest historian Andrés Reséndez estimates the number of Indigenous peoples in Texas to exceed 40,000, compared to just 2,000 Spanish-speaking Mexicans (Reséndez, 2004; 20-21).

Between these islands of supposed control, Spanish-speaking administrators would have found an “alien world.” Rather than anything resembling a Spanish or Mexican nation, the vast majority of Texas and New Mexico, both in terms of land area and population, was composed of sovereign Indigenous peoples (Reséndez, 2004; 21).
