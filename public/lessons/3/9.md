## Horses

Similarly, Cherokee ways of life and subsistence tell us little about Comanches. Comanches derived much of their wealth and military strength from their horses, which formed the basis for their mobile lifestyle and allowed for long-distance trading and systematic raiding of Spanish resources. The same reasons that made these horses valuable to Comanches made their depletion in New Mexico catastrophic to the Spanish.

In 1757, the Spanish census reported more than 7,000 horses. Within twenty years, the ascendent Comanches had picked off the majority of these numbers, whether for trade or incorporation into their own herds. Attempts at resistance often contributed only to the increasing stores of Comanche firearms and horses (Hämäläinen, 2008; 80). Under this constant threat, and unable to mount even a token resistance, a 1775 report from the province begged the Spanish royal council in Mexico City for more horses. Perhaps knowing where the animals would end up, the council would never deliver them, all but submitting to the raids (Hämäläinen, 2008; 75).
