## Alliance on the Plains

Meanwhile, Comanches grew restless. Increasingly stingy Mexican officials refused many of the generous gifts which had maintained the friendship in the Far North. When Comanche requests for military assistance against their Indigenous rivals to the north were refused, Comanches looked elsewhere for allies (DeLay, 2008; 62-63).

Just as Comanches became increasingly dissatisfied with their peace with Mexico, the Jackson administration sought to subdue Indigenous conflict in the West. The result was a remarkable peace among many of the southern plains nations and their eastern neighbors, including the Osages, Wichitas, Kiowas, and Apaches, the very groups against whom Mexican peace had been a valuable insurance. Where Comanches had once looked south to Mexico for trade and friendship, they now looked east. The costs for Mexicoâ€™s Far North would be devastating (DeLay, 2008; 64-68).
