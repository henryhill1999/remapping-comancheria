## The Indigenous Southwest

The Indigenous nations of the Southwest bear little resemblance to those of the Southeast. While peoples such as the Cherokees had adapted a predominantly agricultural lifestyle by the beginning of the 18th century, those in the southern plains were largely nomadic (Treuer 2019; 32-33).

However, we should not mistake such mobility for landlessness. Instead, we see a very different kind of relationship between these peoples and their land. While Comanches and other groups on the southern plains had precise knowledge and ways of marking their territory, they did not continuously inhabit it in the same ways as Cherokees, but migrated seasonally and according to raiding patterns (Barr, 2011; 13). Any Mexicans who ignorantly found themselves on Comanche land would soon come to know of their mistake.
