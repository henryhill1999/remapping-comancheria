## New Mexico, USA

Near the end of the 1840s, a strange thing happened in New Mexico. The Mexican province _became_ American.

For a colonial empire, the transfer and acquisition of land as property makes intuitive sense - territory in an empire is simply a resource which might be used for its wealth. However, neither the US nor Mexico claimed to be empires (at least, not in 1846). Rather, they professed to have a single identity which defined their nations and provided legitimacy to their governments, seeking to spread not only their borders, but also their cultures, languages, religions, and often their very race (Reséndez, 2004; 26; DeLay, 2008; 206-207).

So what are we to make of such a transformation amongst _nation-states_ like the United States and Mexico? In theory, land and membership in a nation-state are not a question of conquest and ownership, but of national identity - something “deep within us, somewhere in the reptilian portion of our brains” (Reséndez, 2004; 3). Most likely, this identity does not change with a simple handshake. How are we to understand what happened in New Mexico with this understanding of identity in mind?
