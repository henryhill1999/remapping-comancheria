Every year on New Year’s Day in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico, many of the town’s residents come together to perform the same unique folk play, Los Comanches. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, Taos was a vital trading hub, connecting Indigenous peoples like Apaches and Comanches with New Mexican villagers and agents of the United States, Spain, and later Mexico. Sitting in a location where Indigenous people exercised great power and influence, the land would nonetheless nominally pass through the hands of these white settler-states. What makes Los Comanches so interesting is its blend of multiple, supposedly disparate identities - featuring Christian imagery and Hispanic traditions alongside a celebration of connection to Indigenous culture. If any performance could appropriately capture the long, complex history of the area, Los Comanches comes close.

Every year on New Years' day, New Mexican villagers resurrect this era of their history, performing Los Comanches, a folk play remembering the complex realities of society on the Spanish borderlands, though the historical roots of the play are ambiguous. Los Comanches depicts a Comanche raid on a New Mexican, town, possibly Tomé, which suffered from repeated raids throughout the 1770s (Brooks, 2002; 4-6).

Placing Taos on a rough historical map of the Southwest, it’s easy to see why Taos gained such attention across societies and cultures. [geographic explanation]

If history is to be any guide, [set of events and narrow attention to hegemonic culture]

Hard not to see many of these terms as writing Indigenous peoples out of history.

Exist only in relation to Europeans (crazy map)

We this explicitly in _Los Comanches_ Modern iterations of the play are contradictory, but in one version, the daughter of the Comanche chief, El Capitán, is captured in the course of the raid. El Capitán negotiates a settlement with the townspeople, receiving a monetary sum and his daughter in exchange for religious objects which had been seized. Puzzlingly, the townspeople secure a promise from the Indians return that they later return the village (Brooks, 2002; 1-3).

Not only does Los Comanches demonstrate the enduring legacy of that people in the region today, it also demonstrates the complexity of life on the imperial borderlands in the 18th and 19th century. Border towns such as Tomé, though situated within the political system of imperial New Spain, nonetheless saw frequent contact and exchange with indigenous groups such as the Comanches. The depiction in the play of residents eager for the raiders to return, while ironic, is not far removed from the reality of commerce, which frequently saw Comanches trading the very same animals which they had plundered from the colonists, alongside other desirable goods such as bison products, firearms, and most of all native slaves (Hämäläinen, 2008; 84-85).

Nearly 150 years ago, the remaining free and independent Comanche people were confined to an Indian Territory reservation. 1875, the date often used to mark the definite end of this process, was not the end of Comanche history, but it did mark a significant shift in the balance of power in the North American southwest (Brooks, 2002; 4). But who were the Comanches, and why was 1875 so significant?

The Comanche peoples had populated the Arkansas river basin since their migration in the 1720s, defying the powerful Apaches and Spanish and settling into the center of a vast and lucrative trading network of slaves, horses, firearms, and other goods (Adelman & Aron, 1999; 833). “By the early 1730s, Comanches controlled most of the major river valleys of the southwestern Plains, as well as the trade with New Mexico” (Hämäläinen, 1998; 489).

If 1875 seems like the remote past, consider that Comanches’ hold on this territory, frustrating ambitious Europeans and indigenous powers alike, endured nearly as long as the period of time that has now elapsed since its end. As key agents of trade in the greater Southwest for over a century, Comanche dominance in the region profoundly shaped the cultural, political, and economic landscape of the region, from the drawing of borders to the writing of plays.

More bluntly, how comfortable can we really be with any concept of “American identity” which excludes Indigenous peoples, who were American millenia before white Europeans landed on the continent (as College Board appears to do in their APUSH framework) [citation]?
