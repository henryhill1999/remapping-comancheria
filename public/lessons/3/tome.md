## Tomé

Tomé is a town in modern New Mexico. It was established when land, which had been abandoned after the Pueblo Revolt, was granted to a new group of settlers in 1739. Once an important town on the Camino Real, a significant trade route, it suffered due to Native American attacks and flooding during the 18th-19th century.
