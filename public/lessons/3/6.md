## Los Comanches

While the continuing performance of the _Los Comanches_ is interesting, in and of itself, perhaps even more interesting is the play’s content. Traditionally, _Los Comanches_ depicts a Comanche raid on a New Mexican, town, possibly Tomé, which suffered from repeated raids throughout the 1770s (Brooks, 2002; 4-6).

Modern iterations of the play differ, but in one version, the daughter of the Comanche chief, El Capitán, is captured in the course of the raid. El Capitán negotiates a settlement, returning the town’s religious icons which had been seized in the raid in exchange for his daughter, accompanied by a significant payment from the townspeople.

Puzzlingly, before the departure of the Comanche raiders, the townspeople secure a promise that they later return the town (Brooks, 2002; 1-3). Why would these townspeople be so eager for the raiders to come back?
