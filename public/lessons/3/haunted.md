## Haunted Landscapes

One English traveler, George Ruxton, offers an account of a community wasting away under Comanche raiding. These images would become common in Mexico’s Far North.

_”Before he left El Gallo an old woman gave Ruxton a medallion that would protect him from los bárbaros and also from the more dangerous weapons of the “enemy of the world, who, she said, was ever hunting after heretics.” On October 21 he arrived at the frontier town of Mapimí, on the edge of the Bolsón, where “the people live in constant dread of the Indians.” Ruxton learned that the surrounding country was “sterile and uninhabited; the villages and ranchos have been deserted, and the fields laid waste by the savages.” He next traveled through what for him was a fascinating, haunted landscape of makeshift crosses, abandoned villages, fallow fields, and ruined homes, until he arrived in Chihuahua City in early November.”_ (DeLay, 2008; 276)
