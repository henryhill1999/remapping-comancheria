## Marking Borders

Comanches, like many Indigenous peoples, had particular ways of demonstrating their territoriality, specific to their environment. Juliana Barr offers an account:

_”Comanches used cairns as markers, perfected a message system that took advantage of high spots and trees to place tally marks for those who might follow, and carved and painted tree trunks with symbols, animals, scenes of daily life, and other designs. They also planted tree saplings with split trunks as a marker for water sources and tied down saplings in a particular direction to signal a path or watering hole. Aging horizontal trees still stand across west Texas as indicators not simply of Comanche passing but of Comanche domain.”_ (Barr, 2011; 33)
