## Eradication

More than economic devastation, the eradication of buffalo on the plains extinguished a key aspect of Comanche culture and society (Hämäläinen, 2008; 337). From cosmology, to ritual practice, to familial relations, nearly every aspect of Comanche life depended on the hunting and consumption of buffalo. Friendship and kinship relations, for example, were established and maintained by the exchange of game as a sign of goodwill (Kavanagh, 1997; 40). It was not merely the livelihood, but the very fabric of Comanche society which became inaccessible with the eradication of the southern herds.

US politicians often invoked myths of inevitable decline - that contact between “civilized” and “uncivilized” peoples was the initial and primary cause of Indigenous decline, whether through cultural inferiority or susceptibility to disease. Here we see the application of _Myth #2_, which absolves the US from culpability for Indigenous decline. Apply the final skill of the _Five Cs_, how does Comanche history refute this idea?

Policies such as forced removal, in the case of the Cherokee, and systematic slaughter of buffalo were a far more direct and immediate cause of Indigenous peoples’ move to reservation life. This policies, deliberately pursued by the United States, demonstrate a direct causality between continuing policy decisions and Indigenous decline.
