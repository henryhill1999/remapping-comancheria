## Article 11

By the time of negotiations to end the US-Mexican war, President Polk had reason to think that Mexico would be relieved to relinquish the territory. In the words of one senator: “the inhabitants of those provinces are assailed by Indians, and the women and children are daily falling into the hands of these roving bands, by whom they are made slaves for life. It would therefore be beneficial to Mexico to take this course” (DeLay, 2008; 294). Article 11 of the peace treaty confidently offered Mexicans security from Indigenous peoples within nominal US territory. Despite the best efforts of the US Army, raids would continue and even intensify, now driven not only by vengeance, but also economic necessity.

Admitting defeat, the US would ultimately seek release from this stipulation, providing ten million dollars to the cash strapped Mexican government and receiving a small part of southern Arizona (DeLay, 2008; 302-303). With this agreement, the nominal territory of the continental US would reach its current borders, though much of the territory remained under Indigenous control.
