## Mapping Sovereignty

As we’ve seen, incorporating the borders which defined the exclusive authority of the Comanches, in other words, their sovereignty, creates a more historically useful map of the Southwest.

> _”Though Spaniards knew well where Apache and later Comanche borders marked their dominion, they had little if any knowledge of the lands beyond those lines. Their lack of geographic knowledge spoke to those borders’ offensive and defensive strengths. Apache and Comanche raids kept others out of their homelands while helping to consolidate and expand their control of land and resources.”_ (Barr, 2011; 38)
