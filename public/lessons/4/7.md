However, the Apaches were not the only other group in the orbit of Comanchería. Other indigenous groups like the Pueblos of New Mexico, the Pawnees of the Missouri river valley, and the Wichitas of the middle Arkansas river valley formed valuable trade partners. Comanches’ need for trade originated from the source of their general prosperity - their exploitation of the great supply of bison on the plains - which nevertheless left them carbohydrate deficient. By intensifying their hunting and trading with other groups, Comanches were able to acquire the carbohydrates they needed to balance their diet while remaining highly mobile (Hämäläinen, 2008; 31).
