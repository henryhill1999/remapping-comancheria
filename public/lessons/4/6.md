## Remapping

In modern times, we often think of maps in terms of states. Today, states often exert their power through extensive administration - demarcating borders, enforcing laws, and providing services. Whether we are visiting a post-office, going through customs, or sat before a judge, the rule of a state is apparent through these institutions. However, these ideas may not cleanly apply to the way we should think about historical mapping. As we’ve seen, much of the land claimed by Mexico was left unadministered and out of their control entirely.

Anthropologists have long recognized that the formal roles and codified institutions of _nation-states_ describe only a small fraction of societies throughout history - trying to apply these ideas to Comanchería leaves us all but blind to the ways in which their society might differ from ours, without being deficient. Instead, we can look to Comanche society and culture to find the factors in their lives which were most significant to their history (DeLay, 2008; 119).
