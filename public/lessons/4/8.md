## Buffalo

However, Comanche society was simultaneously defined by its _material needs_. From the early days of Comanche life on the plains, they were able to use their increasing supply of horses to specialize in super-efficient bison hunting. Soon, they had enough horses to mount all their people, becoming fully mobile and able to follow bison herds through their migration patterns (Hämäläinen, 2008; 30, 66).

Soon, bison hunting became both the literal and figurative center of Comanchería, providing both the subsistence on which they lived as well as a number of secondary products which they could trade with the Spanish, French, or other Indigenous peoples. Adding this information to our map allows us to see how adaptation to geography fueled the demographic explosion of the 1720s-1730s which simultaneously explains Comanche territorial expansion.

While Comanche attention was often focused south of the Rio Grande (and indeed, this is where Mexicans, understandably, paid most attention to their activities), they would always be tied to their northern lands by their reliance on buffalo hunting.
