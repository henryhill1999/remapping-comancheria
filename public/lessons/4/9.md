## Competition and War

This migration was accompanied by a different kind of shift from their neighbors, the Apaches, who shifted away from a nomadic lifestyle in favor of a hybrid economy involving both hunting and sedentary agriculture (Hämäläinen, 2008; 30).

The nomadism of the Comanches and the semi-_sedentary_ lifestyle of the Apaches led them into aggressive conflict over the natural resources of the region. Namely, the river valleys which provided the Comanches with game, water, timber, and pasture also provided the Apaches with irrigation for sustained agriculture. This tension would lead to decades of war over land and resources (Hämäläinen, 2008; 31).
