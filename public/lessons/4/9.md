Already, by mapping the patterns of commerce and production which fueled and asserted Comanche power, a notion of Comanchéria begins to take shape which is much different from mere shaded areas on a map. Comanches did express have the same pretensions to empire as Europeans, casting wide claims over vast swathes of land, but nonetheless found themselves situated at an influential position in the southwest, connecting and controlling the fates of disparate people from Santa Fe to St. Louis through trade. Thus, European style maps fail not only by their omission of Comanche territoriality, but also in the very meaning which they encode.
