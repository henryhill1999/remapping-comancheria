## The Shape of Comanchería

By mapping the patterns of commerce and production which fueled Comanche power, a notion of Comanchéria begins to take shape which is much different than how we typically imagine states or peoples, as shaded areas on a map. While Comanches did not express the same pretensions to empire as Europeans, casting wide claims over vast swathes of land, they nonetheless found themselves situated at an influential position in the Southwest, connecting and controlling the fates of disparate people from Santa Fe to St. Louis through this raiding and trading economy. As vengeance-fueled raiding in Mexico continued to increase in intensity, Comanches came to nearly enter the Mexican capital, with little fear of reprisal. What is perhaps most shocking still is how effectively this massive empire in the center of the continent has been hidden over time.

Nevertheless, throughout this history, Comanches would remain fundamentally dependent on buffalo as their primary food source - the coming decline of that population would threaten the very core of their empire (Treuer, 2019; 82).
