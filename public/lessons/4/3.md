As the Comanches reached the plains, they were able to use their increasing supply of horses to specialize in super-efficient bison hunting. Soon, they had enough horses to mount all their people, becoming fully mobile and able to follow bison herds through their migration patterns. This provided a consistent calorie surplus which powered consistent population growth in the 1720s-1750s (Hämäläinen, 2008; 30, 66).

    “It was also the period when Comanches began to employ the mounted bison chase, which would later become the quintessential symbol of the material prosperity and cultural flamboyance of Plains Indian cultures. In its fully matured form, the chase was as dramatic as it was effective. Riding in full speed alongside a fleeing herd and firing arrows into selected animals, a group of hunters could bring down two to three hundred bison in a single chase that took less than an hour. It was enough to keep several hundred people sheltered, clothed, and nourished for more than a month,” (Hämäläinen, 2008; 38).

Soon, bison hunting became both the literal and figurative center of Comanchería, providing both the subsistence on which they lived as well as a number of secondary products which they could trade with the Spanish, French, or other Indian peoples.
