## The Food Source of the Plains

For nomadic plains people, the North American buffalo herds offered a lucrative source of food and material goods. Though they could not subsist on buffalo alone, the few other things they required could be secured with relative ease.

_“[The early 1700s] was also the period when Comanches began to employ the mounted bison chase, which would later become the quintessential symbol of the material prosperity and cultural flamboyance of Plains Indian cultures. In its fully matured form, the chase was as dramatic as it was effective. Riding in full speed alongside a fleeing herd and firing arrows into selected animals, a group of hunters could bring down two to three hundred bison in a single chase that took less than an hour. It was enough to keep several hundred people sheltered, clothed, and nourished for more than a month,”_ (Hämäläinen, 2008; 38).
