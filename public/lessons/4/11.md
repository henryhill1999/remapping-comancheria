## Raiding

However, as we know, Comanche power often extended far beyond their nominal borders. Bison products were not always sufficient to fuel the Comanches’ rapidly expanding society. As we know, Comanches often resorted to exploiting their military strength by seizing horses, captives, and other goods to be used or sold in their cycle of raiding and trading. The enormous wealth which this produced, together with the perpetual vulnerability which this produced in those raided, opened the door not only to highly sought after goods like firearms, but also to a level of political dominance, granting them influence to effectively pursue diplomacy as well as war (Hämäläinen, 2008; 38-39).

Notice the concentric zones depicted to the south of Comanchería. This represent the rapidly expanding territory over which Comanches conducted raids in the 1820s, 1830s, and 1840s, respectively (map based on Hämäläinen, 2008; 222).
