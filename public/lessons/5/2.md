One path for understanding the geographic footprint of Comanchería is to follow the course of Comanches’ economic and demographic evolution. Historian Pekka Hämäläinen writes that prior to their southward migration and subsequent encounters with European imperialism, Comanches supported themselves on a diverse seasonal economy based around hunting and gathering. However, as they migrated southward, they integrated horses into their economy, which proved to be valuable assets for hunting and warfare (Hämäläinen, 2008; 25).
