The nomadism of the Comanches and the semi-sedentary lifestyle of the Apaches led them into aggressive conflict over the natural resources of the region. Namely, the river valleys which provided the Comanches with game, water, timber, and pasture also provided the Apaches with irrigation for sustained agriculture. This tension would lead to decades of war over land and resources (Hämäläinen, 2008; 31).
