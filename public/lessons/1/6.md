At perhaps a more tangible level, we see this exclusion carried out in the very media we often use to visualize the past. US expansion, a huge and multifaceted process, can be concisely summarized by simply looking at these documents - illustrating the vastness of the Louisiana purchase or the Mexican cession. However, these maps frequently obscure the presence of powerful Indigenous groups in their midst, even as settler-colonialist societies conflicted and treated with them, the Comanches being a prime example of this. At some level, my shock upon learning of _The Comanche Empire_ was a result of never having seen a map that included it - and having seen many which _excluded_ it.
