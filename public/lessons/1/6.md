By continuing to explore these three themes in the coming sections, I hope to illustrate the vast explanatory power which studying Indigenous peoples has for understanding US history. With this history, US history takes on a very different shape, calling into question the common ideas of isolationism, “manifest destiny,” and the very existence of anything approaching a single, clear-cut “American identity.” Not only is leaving Indigenous peoples out of history wrong, it also makes for bad history.
On another note that we’ll revisit in the Conclusion, understanding the history of Indigenous peoples in North America is important in its own right. Collectively, the work of historians in recent decades has changed our understanding of who the Comanches were, how they lived, and the non-trivial part they played in shaping the present. But this is not some novel rediscovery of an antiquated people. Comanches are alive and well in the US today, with rights, political interests, and identities which are founded in this history, as well as their history since [cite Kavanagh/Hamalainen to be safe].
It is my hope that by teaching that history here, I can make a dent in the project of bringing the long-underestimated Comanches into the center of Southwest history - and, perhaps even more importantly, ask some hard questions about how this important part of the United States’ past has been too-often forgotten. In asking these questions, I hope that some of our other blindspots in the past will begin to become more obvious - as we start to think about what history is, how it’s written, and how we interact with it today.
