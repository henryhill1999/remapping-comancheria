Why, though, do we remember only pieces of this history? Why do we remember the War of Independence and not the concurrent wars against Mohawks, Shawnees, Mingoes, and Cherokees, and Creeks as well as the innumerable subsequent wars against other Indigenous peoples in the century to come (Kane, 2018; 44)? Why do we remember the Declaration’s lofty statement that “all men are created equal” and entitled to an unalienable right to liberty while one fifth of all people in the states were enslaved - and not its cynical 27th grievance? Why do we remember the Congress in Philadelphia and not the congress in Chota? Are these not equally the history of the United States of America?
