## The Five Myths

Here, we see the consequences of Indigenous peoples repeatedly being denied the opportunity to contribute to the national narrative, articulated in classrooms, pop culture, and political rhetoric. It is this omission which allowed me to take a collegiate level US history course and remain ignorant of the many nuanced ways in which Indigenous people formed that country.

I more precisely characterize this ignorance with what I call the five myths of Indigenous peoples in US history:

1. Indigenous peoples’ societies and cultures were singular, timeless, and “uncivilized”
1. The decline of Indigenous populations was spontaneous, inevitable, or merely tangential to the history of the United States
1. The United States was destined to expand across North America, independent of the Indigenous civilizations they replaced (manifest destiny)
1. The process of settling this supposedly free, uncivilized land is sufficient to explain the course of American development (the Turnerian frontier)
1. And, therefore, studying Indigenous peoples is unnecessary for understanding the history of the United States.

Whether we accept or reject these myths ultimately determines the kind of history we understand the US to have. This is not a trivial question - just as we look to the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence to understand our rights, those involved in politics have often looked to the past to determine what rights they deem Indigenous people to have. At its worst, these historical distortions have been used to justify dispossession, removal, and worse.
