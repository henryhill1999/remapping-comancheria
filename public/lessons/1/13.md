Understanding the entirety of Indigenous peoples’ histories in North America is far too ambitious for one project, or probably even several. The histories of these civilizations is far too diverse and lengthy to be covered briefly, or generalized from a few examples. Rather, for the same reasons that Hämäläinen’s writing so surprised me upon first read, the history of the _Comanches_ provides a great opportunity to see how the five myths can be understood, identified, and debunked using historical thinking. That is why this project focuses on, but is not limited to, a goal of reconstructing that history - bringing in context where appropriate - and understanding how Indigenous peoples can and do defy the myths perpetuated about them.

As I’ll continue to argue throughout this project, understanding the _Comanches’_ (and other Indigenous peoples’) place in history is not only interesting and important in its own right, but is absolutely essential to understanding how the United States came to be the country it is today.
