# Hello!

Welcome to the online home of my project, _Remapping Comanchería_. My name is Madeleine Hill (she/her) - I’m an undergraduate student studying History and Computer Science at the Minerva Schools at KGI. I’ve developed this project to share some of my history education and apply it critically to the way US History is often taught, even in relatively advanced settings, and especially with regards to Indigenous people. I’ll be focusing on the content of the AP US History (APUSH) framework from the College Board. If you are a teacher or student of this class, this is for you! If not, you’ll learn a thing or two anyway.

First thing’s first. You can navigate forward and backward using the arrows on the bottom right, and even jump around and see your place using the sidebar on the left. There will be more interactivity later on, but this will get you up and running for now!
