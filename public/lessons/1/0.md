## Los Comanches

Nearly 150 years ago, the remaining free and independent Comanche people were confined to an Indian Territory reservation. 1875, the date often used to mark the definite end of this process, was not the end of Comanche history, but it did mark a significant shift in the balance of power in the North American southwest (Brooks, 2002; 4). But who were the Comanches, and why was 1875 so significant?
