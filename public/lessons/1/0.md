## Los Comanches

Every year on New Year’s Day in Ranchos de Taos, New Mexico, many of the town’s residents come together to perform the same unique folk play, _Los Comanches_. \n _Taos_ was a vital trading hub throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, connecting Indigenous peoples like Apaches and Comanches with New Mexican villagers and agents of the United States, Spain, and later Mexico. Sitting in a location where Indigenous people exercised great power and influence, the land would nonetheless nominally pass through the hands of these white settler-states. What makes _Los Comanches_ so interesting is its blend of identity - featuring Christian imagery alongside a celebration of connection to Indigenous culture. If any performance could appropriately capture the long, complex history of the area, _Los Comanches_ comes close.
