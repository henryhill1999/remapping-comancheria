If you were to ask people for the most important year in the history of the United States, a good number would probably say 1776, when the Declaration of Independence was signed and the War of Independence began in earnest. The Declaration, a unanimous statement on the part of the original thirteen colonies, listed the grievances that would carry the fledgling states (not yet a republic) through the difficult impending struggle. This much is probably familiar to most anyone in the United States today.

The events of the founding and those thirteen colonies hold great significance in any account of US history, as they should. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, produced in those years, continue to be foundational to modern political discourse. Even today, how often do politicians, activists, and commentators invoke the lines that “all _men_ are created equal” or speak of “the founders’ intent?” We seem to implicitly understand that the circumstances and ideologies of the United States’ founding ought to inform how we think about it today.
