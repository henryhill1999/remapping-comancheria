It is for this reason that many Indigenous people today see counter-mapping - the often explicitly activist act of resisting colonial domination through cartography, reconceptualizing land on the terms of the colonized. This map, representing the extent of historical Indigenous territory, is based on community-sourced data from <a href=”https://native-land.ca/about/”>Native Land</a>, a Canadian not-for-profit organization which aims to enhance “ the visibility and strength of Indigenous history, narratives that combat colonialism, and education initiatives” [citation https://native-land.ca/about/how-it-works/]. I will continue to use data from them throughout this project.
