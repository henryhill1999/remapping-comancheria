I, myself, am a product of an education system which persists ignorance about Indigenous peoples, their lands, and their histories - and, speaking from experience, it is difficult to know what you don’t know.

To well-intentioned designers of these curricula, it might seem natural for the Comanches and other groups to be mostly or entirely absent from learning standards. After all, the breadth of US history is vast, and there are only so many instructional days in a year. Nonetheless, in the same way that the omission of slavery would produce a fundamental misunderstanding of the Civil War, Jim Crow, and the Civil Rights Movement (not to mention the modern state of political discourse), understanding the role of Indigenous peoples is essential for explaining the Jacksonian era, American expansion, Manifest Destiny, the Turnerian frontier, the Mexican-American War, the Civil War, the “Age of Imperialism,” and the continuing struggle to recognize the promise of equality and inalienable rights articulated by Thomas Jefferson in 1776. Among other things, of course.

These connections are impossible to make unless you already know the history - and many people do not.
