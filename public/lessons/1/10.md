## Why Remapping?

This is one of reasons that some Indigenous people today see counter-mapping, the act of resisting colonial domination through cartography, as a way to reclaim their place in history. Allowing marginalized people to represent themselves on their own terms can be a valuable tool to recover their silenced narratives, but also to gain a more complete view of our own history (“Why it matters,” n.d.). It is less easy to write off US _hegemony_ in North America

Each feature on the current map represents the historical territory of a different Indigenous group. It is based on community-sourced data from [Native Land](https://native-land.ca/about/), a Canadian not-for-profit organization which aims to enhance “the visibility and strength of Indigenous history, narratives that combat colonialism, and education initiatives” (“How it works,” n.d.). This, and other ways of rethinking the spatial organization of North America, is central to developing an understanding of the continent that is does not center the experience of European colonizers, and will continue to be a focus of Remapping Comanchería. I will continue to use data from Native Land throughout this project.
