Nikole Hannah-Jones, writing in contribution to the 1619 project, famously argued that we must face the fact that “one of the primary reasons some of the colonists decided to declare their independence from Britain was because they wanted to protect the institution of slavery” (Hannah-Jones, 2020). So too must we recognize that for speculators and squatters interested in Indigenous land, the liberty secured by independence included the freedom to make war, dispossess, and profit at the expense of Indigenous peoples: “By the eve of the Revolution, early patriots disparaged taxation and tyrannical government, but the borderlands had a different story. The war in the Appalachians was not one of revolutionary ideals, but rather a continuation of the previous war, a fight over land” (Kane, 2018; 3; Ostler, 2020).

Why, though, do we remember only pieces of this history? Why do we remember the War of Independence and not the concurrent wars against Mohawks, Shawnees, Mingoes, and Cherokees, and Creeks as well as the innumerable subsequent wars against other Indigenous peoples in the century to come (Kane, 2018; 44)? Why do we remember the Declaration’s lofty statement that “all men are created equal” and entitled to an unalienable right to liberty while one fifth of all people in the states were enslaved - and not its cynical 27th grievance? Why do we remember the Congress in Philadelphia and no the congress in Chota? Are these not equally the history of the United States of America?
