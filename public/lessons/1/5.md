Not only does _Los Comanches_ demonstrate the enduring legacy of that people in the region today, it also demonstrates the complexity of life on the imperial borderlands in the 18th and 19th century. Border towns such as Tomé, though situated within the political system of imperial New Spain, nonetheless saw frequent contact and exchange with indigenous groups such as the Comanches. The depiction in the play of residents eager for the raiders to return, while ironic, is not far removed from the reality of commerce, which frequently saw Comanches trading the very same animals which they had plundered from the colonists, alongside other desirable goods such as bison products, firearms, and most of all native slaves (Hämäläinen, 2008; 84-85).
