I embarked on this project inspired by the writing of Pekka Hämäläinen, a historian whose 2008 book, _The Comanche Empire_, recovers a surprising history of an Indigenous people called the _Comanches_, or Nʉmʉnʉʉ, in their own language. Hämäläinen writes of the Comanches not merely resisting, but dominating colonists - exploiting technologies of war like horses and firearms to extract the wealth of New Mexico and Texas, and building an empire on the plains that lasted a century and half.

I remember first reading Hämäläinen for a history course. I was shocked. As a former student of the College Board’s AP US History (APUSH) course, I had known of Spanish, French, and British empires in North America; I had even heard the United States and Mexico called empires. And yet, the history I had been taught made no room for Indigenous empires. To my mind, Indigenous people existed, sometimes resisted, receded, and disappeared (Hämäläinen, 2008; 1-2). I was, of course, grossly mistaken.
