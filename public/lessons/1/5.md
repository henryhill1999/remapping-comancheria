> _Geography and the Environment_ (_GEO_) (APUSH Theme 3)

> This theme focuses on the role of geography and both the natural and human-made environments in the social and political developments in what would become the United States.

Geography and ecology in the Southwest and Plains help explain much of the _Comanches_â€™ power in the American Southwest. Two of their most valuable resources, bison (for food and other resources) and horses (for mobility, raiding, and trading) were available to them because of their unique location. Far beyond mere economic goods and tools for conflict, these resources ultimately played a much larger role in Comanche culture, becoming important symbols within the social structure and even in religious ritual [citation].

Simultaneously, Indigenous peoples generally and Comanches specifically played a huge role in actively shaping their environments [is this a key concept? I think it might be] [cite Usner, Hamailanen].

[note ecological role of herd and grassland maintenance].

[key connection, Comanche demographic decline precipitated by US bison policies]

[US significance of Mexican American war and eventual dominance]
