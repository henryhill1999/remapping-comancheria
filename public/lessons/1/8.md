This is one of reasons that some Indigenous people today see counter-mapping, the act of resisting colonial domination through cartography, as a way to reclaim their place in history. Allowing marginalized people to represent themselves on their own terms can be a valuable tool to recover their silenced narratives, but also to gain a more complete view of our own history (“Why it matters,” n.d.).

This map, representing the extent of historical Indigenous territory, is based on community-sourced data from [Native Land](https://native-land.ca/about/), a Canadian not-for-profit organization which aims to enhance “ the visibility and strength of Indigenous history, narratives that combat colonialism, and education initiatives” (“How it works,” n.d.). I will continue to use data from them throughout this project.
