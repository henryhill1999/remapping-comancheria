The Comanche peoples had populated the Arkansas river basin since their migration in the 1720s, defying the powerful Apaches and Spanish and settling into the center of a vast and lucrative trading network of slaves, horses, firearms, and other goods (Adelman & Aron, 1999; 833). “By the early 1730s, Comanches controlled most of the major river valleys of the southwestern Plains, as well as the trade with New Mexico” (Hämäläinen, 1998; 489).
