Section 2, The "Frontier":

> _Migration and Settlement_ (_MIG_) (APUSH Theme 4)
> This theme focuses on why and how the various people who moved to and within the United States both adapted to and transformed their new social and physical environments.

Ever since _Frederick Jackson Turner_’s controversial _frontier thesis_ in 1890s, the rapid phenomenon of US expansion across the North American continent has held centerstage in many accounts of the country’s history. While flawed, _Turner_’s thesis has been hugely influential to the way American history is taught (or, perhaps, mistaught) [citation might be nice]. In a sentence, Turner summarizes his view thus:

> "The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.” (Turner, 1894; 199)

Setting aside the myth of “free land,” Turner nonetheless prompts interesting questions about the role of migration and settlement in US history. The simmering tensions culminating in the Civil War were clearly demonstrated and amplified by the political quarrelling over the designation and admittance of “free” states vs “slave” states [citation, worth more depth?]. Turner himself goes so far as to argue that the frontier was responsible for the development of American democracy and culture (at least up until its “closing”) [citation]. Even today, the former frontier is now often referred to as America’s “heartland” [cite Hoganson], a politically charged but emotionally resonant term to many. To what extent can this history of migration and settlement explain the region’s modern cultural significance, and American “character” more broadly?

Nonetheless, as generations of historians have successfully argued, to accept Turner’s argument at face value [cite Cronon] overlooks a large swathe of Americans whose experiences were not represented by Turner’s idealized settler.
