Even today, New Mexican villagers regularly resurrect this era of their history, performing _Los Comanches_, a folk play remembering the complex realities of society on the Spanish borderlands, though the historical roots of the play are ambiguous. \_Los Comanches \_depicts a Comanche raid on a New Mexican, town, possibly Tomé, which suffered from repeated raids throughout the 1770s (Brooks, 2002; 4-6).
