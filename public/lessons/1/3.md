For evidence of their perceived injury, look no further than the Declaration itself. Its 27th and final grievance alludes to slave revolts (“domestic insurrections”) and appeals to racist anti-Indigenous sentiment amongst colonists, dissatisfied with the peace insisted upon by the crown.

"[King George III] has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions."

While war-fueled prejudice no doubt played a hand in this characterization, it was not merely those on the borderlands who sought continued war and expansion. Elite Anglo-Americans frequently sought to profit from the seizure of Indigenous land, including the Washington and Jefferson families, investors in the Ohio company, whose claims across the mountains were now legally unsanctioned (Kane, 2018; 25).
