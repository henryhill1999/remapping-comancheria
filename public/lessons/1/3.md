## Two congresses

And yet, there are many aspects of the founding that would be less familiar to us. While the actions of the Continental Congress are widely known, many of us would be hard pressed to recall the Cherokees, Mohawks, Ottawas, Shawnees, Nanticokes, and Delawares who met in their own congress that year at Chota, seeking to ensure their continued independence against the continent’s colonial powers (Ostler, 2019; 11; Kane, 2018; 43-47). Perhaps this is because of the different trajectories of those independence projects. Perhaps it is merely an artifact of national identity - what we perceive to be “our” history, as opposed to someone else’s.
