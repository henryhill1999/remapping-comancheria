As I’ll continue to argue throughout this project, understanding the Comanches’ (and other Indigenous peoples’) place in history is not only interesting and important in its own right, but is, at the very least, absolutely essential to understanding how the United States came to be the country it is today.

To anyone studying US History generally or APUSH specifically, the history of Indigenous peoples is central to understanding many key ideas and themes often placed upon the trajectory of the United States through. In this project, we’ll primarily focus on three, which I’ll quickly introduce. Each of these themes will be explored in more depth in the subsequent sections.
