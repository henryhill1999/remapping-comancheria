## The Proclamation of 1763

The Proclamation of 1763, a Royal Proclamation from King George III, forbade settlement and land speculation west of the Appalachian mountains.

Britain had been overwhelmed by Cherokee resistance early in the decade, and sought to end hostilities after a costly campaign, though not before desperate British forces resorted to brutal tactics such as germ warfare and raids targeting noncombatants. In one instance, the Cherokee village of Estatoe, with a population of 2,000 people, was set ablaze. Residents who were not burned alive in their homes were picked off by British guns as they tried to flee (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014; 68-19).

Faced with massive debt, Britain could not afford to maintain these costly conflicts, and hoped to benefit from trade with Indigenous peoples by prohibiting settlement and expansion west of the Appalachian mountains. Here is an approximation of the boundary imposed by the proclamation.
