## Rethinking Removal

When we are forced to recognize the massive state apparatus which was necessary to uproot and remove sovereign peoples from supposedly “free land,” our expectations of the mythologized frontier seem to be called into question. How can land inhabited by Cherokees, for example, be thought to be wilderness? 

Such a leap requires delegitimizing Indigenous sovereignty, society, and the very ways in which they related to their land. For the Cherokee, it requires that we ignore not only their traditional culture and way of life, but also the ways they adapted to and resisted colonization: the treaties they made with the United States, the boundaries they created and enforced, the wars they fought to protect themselves and their land, the writings and speeches in which they pronounced their inherent rights, the court cases which they prosecuted to protect those rights, their Constitution, and the governments they elected.

Turner saw the frontier as the very line between "savagery and civilization" (Turner, 1894), but this is only possible if we discount nearly every aspect of Cherokee life which made them unique, supported them for millennia before contact, and allowed them to continually adapt and persist into the present day. To accept this notion is to deny Cherokee identity specifically, and Indigenous humanity more generally. In other words, to see Indigenous society and culture as singular, timeless, and “uncivilized” (_Myth #1_).
