## Slavery

There is no getting around the role of slavery in removal.

The passage of the Removal Act through congress was by no means a given. Throughout the country, it found widespread opposition from legislators who rightly found it a “national disgrace” (Saunt, 2020; 78). Nonetheless, among the southern sates of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, congressional support for removal was unanimous, often with the explicit end of expanding their slave economies. Claudio Saunt accounts for the perverse politics of its passage:

> _As a result of the Constitution’s three-fifths clause, slave states wielded an extra twenty-one votes in Congress in 1830. [...] Planters used the votes accorded to them for owning slaves to make room for more slaves. By a narrow margin of five votes, they succeeded in passing an act designed to open up vast territory for industrial-scale cotton production. Through its passage, hundreds of thousands of fertile acres - the ancestral lands of native peoples - would become part of the empire of slave labor camps that was rapidly expanding across the Lower South._ (Saunt, 2020; 77) 

In the words of Saunt, removal was “the war the slaveholders won.”
