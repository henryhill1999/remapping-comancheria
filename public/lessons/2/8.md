What does understanding Turner’s thesis mean for how we should think about Georgia’s history? Consider how the myth of “free land” guided and justify the state’s expansion.

Anglo-Americans in Georgia owned and inhabited only a narrow strip of coastline in 1776, seized before the War of Independence. So limited was Georgian control over its imagined territory, the 1802 Georgia compact rescinded the state’s transcontinental claims only in exchange for promises of federal removal of sovereign Cherokees and Muscogees from supposedly Georgian land, in direct violation of federal treaties (Bens, 2020; 53).
