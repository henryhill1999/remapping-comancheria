For years, squatters and speculators had been crossing into Cherokee and Muscogee lands, much as in the case of the Ohio company up north, featured in the introduction. For many, there was an obvious economic interest in the availability of cheap, supposedly free land.

However, not all land was created equal. Land in eastern Georgia, which had for millenia supported the sustained the livelihoods of Indigenous peoples, had, in a matter of decades, been severely degraded by the exploitative cash-crop agriculture of Anglo-Americans. It was these wealthy plantation owners who were among the loudest voices for removal (Saunt, 2020; 32). Meanwhile, just west lay some of the richest agricultural lands in the Americas, the Black Prairie. The mineral rich soil of the Black Prairie enabled the Cherokees, Muscogees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws to thrive in their homelands, but to settlers, it was prime cotton land (Saunt, 2020; 192-196). 

These would be the the same lands where the brutal institution of United States slavery would grow and perversely flourish.
