## Treaty of New Echota

This is the land transferred by the Treaty of New Echota.

In December 1835, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation, John Ross, was in Washington DC. In his absence, an unelected group of a couple hundred individual Cherokees signed the Treaty of New Echota, under terms which would provide $5 million dollars and land in Oklahoma in exchange for the remainder of Cherokee territory east of the Mississippi. The treaty party, claiming to represent their 16,000 member tribe, had “no formal authority” (Saunt, 2020; 238-239)

The decision was unpopular with the majority of Cherokees, and was against the will of their elected government. Nonetheless, the United States accepted this basis to complete the forced expulsion of Cherokees from their homeland. Just two years later, the US Army deported the Cherokees remaining in their territory in a 1,200 mile forced journey sometimes known as the Trail of Tears. Up to 7% of the Cherokee population is estimated to have died on this six month journey (NCDCR, n.d.).
