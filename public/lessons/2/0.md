## Mapping and European Representation

In 1763, amidst the steady escalation of Comanche raids on New Mexico, the European powers in North America signed the Treaty of Paris, ending the Seven Years’ War and completing the transfer of France’s North American claims to Spain and Britain (the Louisiana territory had been ceded to Spain a year earlier by the Treaty of Fontainebleau). The result was an apparently enlarged Spanish domain, stretching from the banks of the Mississippi to the west coast of the continent (Hämäläinen, 2008; 50-51, 68).

    Bowen, Emanuel, J Gibson, and Robert Sayer. _An accurate map of North America. Describing and distinguishing the British, Spanish and French dominions on this great continent; according to the definitive treaty concluded at Paris 10th Feby. Also all the West India Islands belonging to, and possessed by the several European princes and states. The whole laid down according to the latest and most authentick improvements_.

However, this map should immediately provoke some skepticism. For all the talk of borderlands and Comanche dominance in the region, there’s a suspicious absence of actual borders in this representation. In other words, where are the Comanches?
