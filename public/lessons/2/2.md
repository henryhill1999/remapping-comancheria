## American Progress

Indigenous peoples, including Comanches, are often remembered in terms of the American frontier. Specifically, as those on the other side of it. However, exactly what defines the frontier has always been an open question. To some, the frontier was a zone of cultural interchange, where nationality and ethnicity often blended in ambiguous ways (Faragher, 1994; 232). To others, the frontier is imagined to have been a clear, constantly moving line which demarcated Anglo-American settlement from land inhabited by Indigenous peoples. In the romanticised language of US nationalism, it is sometimes imagined to have been the very line between civilization and wilderness, demanding a rugged individualism which formed the basis of a unique American identity.

Understanding the ways in which the frontier has been thought of and mythologized is a history unto itself. However, one does not need to look far to see how the kind of imagery depicted, for example, in the painting of John Gast (previous slide) perpetuated a profound ignorance of how US expansion actually occurred.

In this section, _The Frontier_, we will see how some ideas of frontier came to govern the way we think about expansion, and how the mythology of the frontier and history do not always agree.
