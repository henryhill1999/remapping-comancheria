## The Southern Frontier?

The erasure of Indigenous sovereignty was not only carried out at the time by the creation of fictitious maps, but also in the very way we have thought about expansion since. To understand this the role which notions of the frontier have had on our thinking, we need to turn to _historiography_ - the study of historical writing itself. That is, we must think not only about what the frontier was truly _like_, but also how people have _thought it to be_. As we will see, there can be a big difference between the two.

_Frederick Jackson Turner_, writing in the 1890s, famously depicted the United States’ western frontier, invoking romantic images of a “primitive” society, and argued that the “great West,” not the Atlantic coast, be the “true point of view” in the history of the United States. Summarized in a single sentence, Turner put forth his influential and controversial _frontier thesis_:

> "The existence of an area of free land, its continuous recession, and the advance of American settlement westward, explain American development.” (Turner, 1894; 199)

So pivotal has Turner been to the way that historians and the public have understood US history, any discussion of the frontier which neglects that influence risks appearing ignorant of that scholarship. As William Cronon writes, the obligatory summarization of Turner is tantamount to “engag[ing] in ritual” (Cronon, 1987; 157).
