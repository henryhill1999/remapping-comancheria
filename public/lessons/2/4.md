## Georgia

Looking at most maps of the United States around its founding, Georgia might look unfamiliar, but nonetheless recognizable. Prior to the incorporation of the modern American South, much of that land was claimed by Georgia. In fact, until the 1802 Georgia compact, the state did not recognize a western boundary, stretching its supposed territory to the Pacific Ocean (Bens, 2020; 53). Taking these claims at face value, this would have included the site of modern Los Angeles (depiction [here](https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/history-archaeology/boundaries-georgia)).
