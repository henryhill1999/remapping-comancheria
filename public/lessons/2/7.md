This formulation of territory is intimately linked to the idea of land as property. One of the earliest modern philosophers, John Locke, who is still commonly taught in many introductory courses, had a particular view that property is derived from the act of labor - i.e. that by improving a natural resource, one gains ownership of that resource. However, the converse of this argument is perhaps just as important: that American Indians fail to improve their land and do not, therefore, individually own it (Buckle, 2001).
