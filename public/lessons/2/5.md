## Georgia

While any notion of a transcontinental Georgia is an obvious fiction, even the more familiar depictions radically obscure the amount of land under the sovereignty of Indigenous peoples, as recognized even by federal treaties. Though those borders would change over time, Indigenous sovereignty in their homelands was not just legal fact, but a reality of everyday life for Georgians. Those borders became very real to squatters who were regularly ejected for encroaching on Indigenous land. And the prolonged periods of relentless war against these groups rival any other foreign war in the country’s history. In terms of years, the wars with the Seminole Nation from 1817 to 1858 dwarf the United States’ conflicts in Vietnam, Afghanistan, and Iraq (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014; 101).

Despite these commonly understood realities, contemporary and even modern historical maps often refuse to depict these Indigenous nations with the same borders they reserved for European domains (Jortner, 2015; 74).
