> _“Removing Indians from the American South did not happen suddenly, quickly, or in secret. The act was the result of a national debate that began decades earlier. Led by President Andrew Jackson, those in favor saw Indian nations as an obstacle to economic development and a threat to national security. Opponents, including Native leaders, argued that the act went against democratic values. Ultimately removal presented a moral test to the new nation. Could the United States stay true to its ideals? Could it bring prosperity to the South and also treat American Indians with justice and respect? The nation tried to accomplish both goals. It succeeded at only one.”_ (NMAI, 2018)
