Rather than mapping the realities of colonial and indigenous power on the ground, it seems this map aims to represent a more abstract claim to political authority, which their claimants could not, at all times, exercise. Far from the expansive swathes of land that the map portrays under Spanish control, many inhabitants of the land would be surprised to discover that they lived in New Spain. To take an example from one of the corners of the empire \_more \_frequented by Europeans, “only a handful of Spanish officials actually set foot in Missouri” (Adelman & Aron, 1999; 825).

    “French defeat in 1762 might have brought relief to northern Mexican outposts: gone were the French trading parties plying their contraband through the silver provinces, gone was the French military threat from Louisiana. Viceregal authorities breathed a sigh of relief. They did not account for the defensive agency of Indians themselves, for the Comanche-Apache conflict only intensified” (Adelman & Aron, 1999; 833).
