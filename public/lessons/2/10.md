## Jackson

However, the march towards dispossession was neither constant nor inevitable (_Myth #2_). Even by 1828, Cherokees held on not only to much of their lands (despite intense coercive pressure to give up those claims) but also saw a robust growth in population, frustrating narratives of a “dying race” (Saunt, 2020; 16-17). Given the federal government’s power to make and enforce treaties with sovereign nations, the state of Georgia could not actually force Indigenous peoples to move, at least not on its own.

The 1828 election pitted Andrew Jackson against incumbent President, John Quincy Adams. Adams had opposed the worst of the duplicitous treaties and insisted that any removal must be voluntary (Saunt, 2020; 34-38), while Jackson, who had lost the election just four years previously, campaigned on the promise of forced removal (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014; 109). 

The course of Indigenous history in the southeast was redefined when Jackson was elected by a substantial margin. In Georgia, Jackson secured 97% of ballots cast, but in a country of 13 million people, he received only 642,806 votes (Saunt, 2020; 48-49). With Jackson’s election hinging on a fraction of enfranchised white men, I can’t help but wonder how history might have looked in a more democratic United States. Under Jackson’s direction, the Indian Removal Act was passed in 1830 (Saunt, 2020; 79). _The Treaty of New Echota_ would be signed before the end of his presidency.
