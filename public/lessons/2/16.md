## The Legacy of Andrew Jackson

Slave-owning settlers did not move into untouched land, but took possession of land which had been cultivated for centuries by Indigenous peoples. The ecology of the American South, its grazing lands and pastures which made the lands so valuable to slaveholders, were not spontaneous, but intentionally created by and for thriving Indigenous peoples (Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014; 28-29). While the myth of North American wilderness erases the histories of Indigenous peoples who lived there, it also erases the ways in which they shaped the land which would come to define American history. 

Without the explosion of the slave economy throughout the southern Black Prairie, one wonders if there would have been a Civil War. The language of Georgia’s slave owning governor foreshadows the conflict as early as the 1820s, advising Georgians to “defend [their] property with reason to the last, and with arms when ‘argument failed,’” just as he accused President Adams of “fomenting Civil War” (Saunt, 2020; 35-36)

Removal would make waves both inside and outside the United States. As one of the first state-sponsored mass expulsions in the modern world, its execution was well-known to the architects of the Holocaust. In his conquest of Eastern Europe, Adolf Hitler would famously compare the regions inhabitants to “Indians,” pronouncing “the Volga must be our Mississippi” (Saunt, 2020; xvi). Such is the legacy of the man on the $20 bill.
