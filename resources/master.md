## Los Comanches

Nearly 150 years ago, the remaining free and independent Comanche people were confined to an Indian Territory reservation. 1875, the date often used to mark the definite end of this process, was not the end of Comanche history, but it did mark a significant shift in the balance of power in the North American southwest (Brooks, 2002; 4). But who were the Comanches, and why was 1875 so significant?

The Comanche peoples had populated the Arkansas river basin since their migration in the 1720s, defying the powerful Apaches and Spanish and settling into the center of a vast and lucrative trading network of slaves, horses, firearms, and other goods (Adelman & Aron, 1999; 833). “By the early 1730s, Comanches controlled most of the major river valleys of the southwestern Plains, as well as the trade with New Mexico” (Hämäläinen, 1998; 489).

#

If 1875 seems like the remote past, consider that Comanches’ hold on this territory, frustrating ambitious Europeans and indigenous powers alike, endured nearly as long as the period of time that has now elapsed since its end. As key agents of trade in the greater Southwest for over a century, Comanche dominance in the region profoundly shaped the cultural, political, and economic landscape of the region, from the drawing of borders to the writing of plays.

#

Even today, New Mexican villagers regularly resurrect this era of their history, performing _Los Comanches_, a folk play remembering the complex realities of society on the Spanish borderlands, though the historical roots of the play are ambiguous. \_Los Comanches \_depicts a Comanche raid on a New Mexican, town, possibly Tomé, which suffered from repeated raids throughout the 1770s (Brooks, 2002; 4-6).

#

Modern iterations of the play are contradictory, but in one version, the daughter of the Comanche chief, El Capitán, is captured in the course of the raid. El Capitán negotiates a settlement with the townspeople, receiving a monetary sum and his daughter in exchange for religious objects which had been seized. Puzzlingly, the townspeople secure a promise from the Indians return that they later return the village (Brooks, 2002; 1-3).

#

Not only does _Los Comanches_ demonstrate the enduring legacy of that people in the region today, it also demonstrates the complexity of life on the imperial borderlands in the 18th and 19th century. Border towns such as Tomé, though situated within the political system of imperial New Spain, nonetheless saw frequent contact and exchange with indigenous groups such as the Comanches. The depiction in the play of residents eager for the raiders to return, while ironic, is not far removed from the reality of commerce, which frequently saw Comanches trading the very same animals which they had plundered from the colonists, alongside other desirable goods such as bison products, firearms, and most of all native slaves (Hämäläinen, 2008; 84-85).

## Mapping and European Representation

In 1763, amidst the steady escalation of Comanche raids on New Mexico, the European powers in North America signed the Treaty of Paris, ending the Seven Years’ War and completing the transfer of France’s North American claims to Spain and Britain (the Louisiana territory had been ceded to Spain a year earlier by the Treaty of Fontainebleau). The result was an apparently enlarged Spanish domain, stretching from the banks of the Mississippi to the west coast of the continent (Hämäläinen, 2008; 50-51, 68).

    Bowen, Emanuel, J Gibson, and Robert Sayer. _An accurate map of North America. Describing and distinguishing the British, Spanish and French dominions on this great continent; according to the definitive treaty concluded at Paris 10th Feby. Also all the West India Islands belonging to, and possessed by the several European princes and states. The whole laid down according to the latest and most authentick improvements_. [London, Printed for Robt. Sayer, 1763] Map. https://www.loc.gov/item/74693869/.

However, this map should immediately provoke some skepticism. For all the talk of borderlands and Comanche dominance in the region, there’s a suspicious absence of actual borders in this representation. In other words, where are the Comanches?

#

Rather than mapping the realities of colonial and indigenous power on the ground, it seems this map aims to represent a more abstract claim to political authority, which their claimants could not, at all times, exercise. Far from the expansive swathes of land that the map portrays under Spanish control, many inhabitants of the land would be surprised to discover that they lived in New Spain. To take an example from one of the corners of the empire \_more \_frequented by Europeans, “only a handful of Spanish officials actually set foot in Missouri” (Adelman & Aron, 1999; 825).

    “French defeat in 1762 might have brought relief to northern Mexican outposts: gone were the French trading parties plying their contraband through the silver provinces, gone was the French military threat from Louisiana. Viceregal authorities breathed a sigh of relief. They did not account for the defensive agency of Indians themselves, for the Comanche-Apache conflict only intensified” (Adelman & Aron, 1999; 833).

#

Meanwhile, the southwest was not merely militarily crippled by the Comanches, but was simultaneously dependent on their trade. In 1769 letter to the Viceroy, the Governor of New Mexico admitted as much, explaining the need to reopen trade with the Comanches or face economic collapse (Hämäläinen, 2008; 84).

#

Given the intense difficulties of colonial governance in the borderlands New Mexico colony, in the shadow of Comanche abundance, it is all the more surprising that the Comanches were excluded entirely from many maps at the time (looking at you, “accurate map of North America”). This is explained somewhat when the process of cartography is viewed not merely as an act of descriptive illustration, but also as an exercise of power.

#

Historian Pekka Hämäläinen, in his book _The Comanche Empire_, describes this process as an act of “cartographic dispossession,” by which indiginous claims were intentionally “diminished and delegitimized” (Hämäläinen, 2008; 195). This dispossession was not by any means limited to the Comanche, but is clearly illustrated by their case.

#

Comanches did not, themselves, construct durable maps (certainly not the kind that Europeans would recognize) and did not articulate territorial claims in the same way as European colonists (Rivaya-Martínez, 2019; 13:00). However, over time, this difference became not just an inconvenience to cartographers, but a moral justification for the United States’ and others’ conquest of Indian territory.

#

In this way, it makes far more sense to interpret these maps not as descriptive guides to the habitation patterns of European powers, but rather as the assertion of property over the territories, predicated on the idea that native peoples like the Comanches could not be said to own the land they inhabited. “That nomads do not develop the land is a fallacy used to legitimize their dispossession” (Rivaya-Martínez, 2019; 22:00).

#

This formulation of territory is intimately linked to the idea of land as property. One of the earliest modern philosophers, John Locke, who is still commonly taught in many introductory courses, had a particular view that property is derived from the act of labor - i.e. that by improving a natural resource, one gains ownership of that resource. However, the converse of this argument is perhaps just as important: that American Indians fail to improve their land and do not, therefore, individually own it (Buckle, 2001).

#

In other words, “because Indians supposedly failed to increase the productivity of the land, they could rightfully be dispossessed of it” (Usner, 2009; 8). It bears saying that this understanding the many ways in which indigenous peoples engaged in cultivation and landscape management (Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, 2014; )

What does this mean for the “Vast Tract of Land Unknown” inhabited by the Comanches? Well, at the turn of the 19th century, very little. As early as 1776, colonial officials deemed New Mexico troops “useless,” kept chronically horse poor by Comanche raids against which the Spanish were therefore unable to retaliate (Hämäläinen, 2008; 75).

#

Nonetheless, the persistence of these maps into the present day has the effect of erasing Comanche power and the power of other indigenous Americans from history. Visually excluding the domains of American Indian political power from maps, especially in the classroom, discounts the geopolitical significance of these groups across the continent, and entertains a fiction that all of North America fell under European dominion simply by claim. Not only does this make for bad history, but it degrades indigenous claims to the land which they inhabited and developed for millennia before contact.

#

## Remapping - the shape of Comanche society

One might say then, that the area of Comanchería was a fundamentally different kind of space when compared to the representations of European empires shown on contemporary maps. Rather than representing an area aspirationally claimed by an imperial project, Comanchería was defined by the natural and economic landscape which Comanches inhabited, subsisted on, and dominated.

#

Imagine drawing this on a map - patterns of migration, commerce, military dominance, spiritual significance, and continuous ecological cultivation. Ultimately, it’s no wonder that European cartographers were unable to the complex ways in which the Comanches related to their territory in order to exercise power. Where Anglo-Europeans used state institutions such as post offices to project cultural and economic power, the Comanches used military and commercial domination not to expand their territory, but to derive wealth.

#

One path for understanding the geographic footprint of Comanchería is to follow the course of Comanches’ economic and demographic evolution. Historian Pekka Hämäläinen writes that prior to their southward migration and subsequent encounters with European imperialism, Comanches supported themselves on a diverse seasonal economy based around hunting and gathering. However, as they migrated southward, they integrated horses into their economy, which proved to be valuable assets for hunting and warfare (Hämäläinen, 2008; 25).

[indicate migration on map]

#

As the Comanches reached the plains, they were able to use their increasing supply of horses to specialize in super-efficient bison hunting. Soon, they had enough horses to mount all their people, becoming fully mobile and able to follow bison herds through their migration patterns. This provided a consistent calorie surplus which powered consistent population growth in the 1720s-1750s (Hämäläinen, 2008; 30, 66).

    “It was also the period when Comanches began to employ the mounted bison chase, which would later become the quintessential symbol of the material prosperity and cultural flamboyance of Plains Indian cultures. In its fully matured form, the chase was as dramatic as it was effective. Riding in full speed alongside a fleeing herd and firing arrows into selected animals, a group of hunters could bring down two to three hundred bison in a single chase that took less than an hour. It was enough to keep several hundred people sheltered, clothed, and nourished for more than a month,” (Hämäläinen, 2008; 38).

Soon, bison hunting became both the literal and figurative center of Comanchería, providing both the subsistence on which they lived as well as a number of secondary products which they could trade with the Spanish, French, or other Indian peoples.

#

#

This migration was accompanied by a different kind of shift from their neighbors, the Apaches, who shifted away from the plains culture in favor of a hybrid economy involving both hunting and sedentary agriculture (Hämäläinen, 2008; 30).

[indicate Apaches on map]

#

The nomadism of the Comanches and the semi-sedentary lifestyle of the Apaches led them into aggressive conflict over the natural resources of the region. Namely, the river valleys which provided the Comanches with game, water, timber, and pasture also provided the Apaches with irrigation for sustained agriculture. This tension would lead to decades of war over land and resources (Hämäläinen, 2008; 31).

#

However, the Apaches were not the only other group in the orbit of Comanchería. Other indigenous groups like the Pueblos of New Mexico, the Pawnees of the Missouri river valley, and the Wichitas of the middle Arkansas river valley formed valuable trade partners. Comanches’ need for trade originated from the source of their general prosperity - their exploitation of the great supply of bison on the plains - which nevertheless left them carbohydrate deficient. By intensifying their hunting and trading with other groups, Comanches were able to acquire the carbohydrates they needed to balance their diet while remaining highly mobile (Hämäläinen, 2008; 31).

[indicate other groups on map]

#

However, bison products were not always sufficient to fuel the Comanches rapidly expanding society. In many cases, as mentioned earlier, the Comanches simply resorted to exploiting their military strength by seizing horses, slaves, and other goods to be used or sold in their cycle of hunting and trade. The enormous wealth which this produced, in tandem with the perpetual weakness which this produced in those raided, opened the door not only to highly sought after goods like firearms, but also to a level of political dominance (Hämäläinen, 2008; 38-39).

    [Visualization might look something like this at this point (Hämäläinen, 1998; 487).]

Already, by mapping the patterns of commerce and production which fueled and asserted Comanche power, a notion of Comanchéria begins to take shape which is much different from mere shaded areas on a map. Comanches did express have the same pretensions to empire as Europeans, casting wide claims over vast swathes of land, but nonetheless found themselves situated at an influential position in the southwest, connecting and controlling the fates of disparate people from Santa Fe to St. Louis through trade. Thus, European style maps fail not only by their omission of Comanche territoriality, but also in the very meaning which they encode.

#

Mapping Comanchería as an economic, rather than simply territorial entity, displays the vastness of Comanche influence, even at its inception before the 19th century. Going forward, Comanches would continue to contend with and challenge European imperialism, offering not merely resistance but a convincing alternative center of power which would shape geopolitics and culture for centuries to come.
